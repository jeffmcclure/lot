### Stay a while and listen
This module is 99% the same as Tolitz Rosel's last released version 1.06 from November 27, 2004.  

### Major Changes Since 1.06
#### Technical
* Using [Neverwinter Toolkit](https://github.com/jeffmcclure/nwt) to manage project in source format
* Using github for [module source code](https://github.com/jeffmcclure/lot)
* Using github for [hak source code](https://github.com/jeffmcclure/lothak)
* Only one module-specific hak file needed, lot2.hak
* All media resources are part of the new lot2.hak, no need for separate music or video files
* Using [CEP 3.1.1c](https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwnee/hakpak/combined/cep-3-community-expansion-pack)
* Module version number uses [Semantic Versioning Standard](https://semver.org)

#### Multi-player Focused
* Quests shared with party
* Quest-level rewards shared with entire party
* Per-player loot generated in many situations (players can only pick up their assigned loot)
* Keep TheeMon around for late joiners
 
#### Gameplay
* Bug squashed that would sometimes prevent henchmen Jarulf and Jenna from joining
* New haggling/appraise system for all stores
* Some chests must now be picked open, and may not be bashed open
* A few new minor quests at game opening
* New starting item "Cloak of Fast Feet"
* Portal location moved to center of town
