The misshapen figures of the statues were designed to taunt and anger any demons that attempted to gain entrance. Diablo worked to unlock the wards that protected these granite images, and eventually was able to gift them with a Hadean life. The Gargoyles arose from their captive sleep and swooped down to prey upon those whom they were created to protect. Naturally, the remaining statues were immediately destroyed, but there are Signum that escaped and continue to terrorize the innocent to this day.\n\nThe act of transforming from flesh to stone allows the creature to heal any wounds that it has suffered, so it is best to either\navoid these demons entirely or to hunt them down until they are dead. Do not allow them to flee, for they will soon return in full force."
