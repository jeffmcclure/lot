  "Comment" : "Generic trigger that controls a CEP trap placeble.  The following setup is required:\r\n\r\nNote: This trigger and scripts were designed for a generic trigger, not a trap trigger.  A trap trigger cannot be reset after a disarm or recover.\r\n\r\nIf you do set it up as a trap trigger, move the OnEnter script from the OnEnter event to the OnTriggered event.  It should work until it has been disarmed or recovered.\r\n\r\nSetup required:\r\n1. Place a generic trigger in your area\r\n2. Place the script cs_oe_trapcep in the OnEnter event of the trigger\r\n3. Place the script cs_ox_trapcep in the OnExit event\r\n4. Place the CEP trap placeable on or above the trigger (unless you want the trap to remain \"hidden\" prior to being triggered, in which case the HiddenTrap parameter needs to be set to TRUE and the TrapResRef parameter requires the resref of the trap.\r\n5. Configure the trap \"parameters\" using local variables stored on the trigger. Local variables are set from the \"variables\" button on the Advanced\" tab of the trigger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Continued...)\r\n\r\nThe following parameters are configurable and can be setup as local variables on the trigger.
