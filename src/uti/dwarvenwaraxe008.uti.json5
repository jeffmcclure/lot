  "DescIdentified" : "The Battleroarer family maintained an inn alongside the river Delimbiyr, frequented mainly by adventurers.  A trio of red robed Thayan wizards blasted the inn and all within it to dust over a disagreement resulting from the Battleroarer's refusal to offer service to the distrustful wizards.  Hagan Battleroar, just a young dwarf at the time, was tending to the family's herd of sheep on a nearby hill and saw the massacre.  Hagan abandoned his family's peaceful ways and with steadfast perseverance became a dwarven defender.  He crafted this weapon to aid him in a vendetta against all users of magic, specifically the Thayans.  His clan recently began asking for news of Hagan's whereabouts, after he disappeared recently tracking several red wizards near the mouth of the Underdark.",
