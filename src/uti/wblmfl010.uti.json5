  "DescIdentified" : "The High Inquisitor of Auril was a bitterly cold woman with a penchant for crushing her enemies' skulls with her magical mace.  This diabolical fetish led her to hunt for better, more effective weapons, until she found the Foundation mace.  Armed with the ultimate mace, the inquisitor led her soldiers in an attack on a clan of ogres who refused to work for her army.  While the mace destroyed many ogres, it disappeared along with its owner, when she was taunted into following an ogre mage into the caverns the ogres called home.",
