  "DescIdentified" : "This book contains an excerpt of the Sin War.  Most noteable are these passages:\n\n\"...This jealousy of Man led to harsh, atrocious acts of violence by the demons against the mortal realm.  Some men learned of this deep hatred and used it against the denizens of the Underworld.  One such mortal, Horazon the Summoner, delighted in summoning demons and then breaking them to his will.  Horazon, along with his brother Bartuc, were members of the Eastern mage clan known as the Vizjerei.  This mystic clan studied the ways of demons and had catalogued their lore for generations.  Empowered by this knowledge, Horazon was able to take the work of the Vizjerei and pervert it for his demented purposes.  The denizens of Hell sought revenge against this bold mortal,but Horazon managed to keep himself well protected within his arcane sanctuary.\n\nBartuc, the brother of Horazon, was eventually lured to the side of Darkness.  He was granted exceptional strength and longevity, and fought alongside the legions of Hell against the cursed Vizjerei, and eventually his own brother during the Sin War.  Although Bartuc was renowned  amongst the warriors of many realms, his dominance in battle came with a terrible price.  An insatiable lust for mortal blood pervaded his every thought and deed.  Bartuc soon became as fond of bathing in the blood of his enemies as he did of shedding it, and in time he came to be known only as the Warlord of Blood...\"",
