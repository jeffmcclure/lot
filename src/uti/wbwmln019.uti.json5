  "DescIdentified" : "This finely-crafted longbow most recently belonged to the Arcane Archer Ferran Valiantheart... and has been passed down from generation to generation within the Valiantheart clan for thousands of years.  The magic of the bow, a spell written into the grain of the wood in the elven language, is designed to enhance a hunter's senses... making it easier to spot one's prey and the archer more accurate with his arrow when firing",
