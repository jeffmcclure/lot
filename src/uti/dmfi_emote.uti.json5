  "DescIdentified" : "The DMFI Emote Wand, unlike the PC version, is targetable. If you have a target for the DMFI Emote Wand, the target plays the animation chosen instead of the wand user.\n\nEmotes:\n-Drink\n-Drunk\n-Fall Prone\n-Follow Nearest PC\n-Meditate/Pray\n-Read\n-Sit on the Floor\n-Worship\n\nMore Emotes:\n-Beg\n-Dance\n-Get Low\n-Get Mid\n-Sit in Nearest Chair\n-Sit on the Floor and Drink\n-Sit on the Floor and Read\n-Smoke\n-Threaten\n\nLoop Mode:\nWhen you select Loop Mode, any emote that you select from the list will take you back to the loop mode conversation. This way, you can \"chain\" your emotes without having to reuse the wand constantly.\n\nRedesigned By Hahnsoo (hahns_shin@hotmail.com)\n\nOriginal Design by Jhenne and Doppleganger.",
