There are two functions:\n1) Aim the Unique Power at an NPC to set that NPC as your target for Ditto Mode. Type \"/dm :What you want to say\" to make the NPC say that. It also targets the NPC for .commands and other functions.\n2) Aim the Unique Power at the ground to create a Voice there. You can throw your voice to that Voice's location by typing \"/dm :What you want to say\". Useful for flavor text on the fly.",
