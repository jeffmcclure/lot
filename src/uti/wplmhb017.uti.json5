Not many adventurers wish to test them thoroughly, however, as they were apparently designed specifically to combat elementals.  The sect that created these halberds refer to themselves as \"Purists Against the Pure,\" claiming that nothing is more unnatural than the manifestation of a single natural element.  They seek to destroy such \"unbalanced\" creatures, though their own weapons seem similarly uniform.",
